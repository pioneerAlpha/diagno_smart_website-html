          This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and (under certain
          conditions) disclose your personal information. This Privacy Policy
          also explains the steps we have taken to secure your personal
          information. Finally, this Privacy Policy explains your options
          regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal
          information. By visiting the Site directly or through another site,
          you accept the practices described in this Policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Data protection is a matter of trust, and your privacy is important to
          us. We shall therefore only use your name and other information which
          relates to you in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We will
          only collect information where we must do so, and we will only collect
          information if it is relevant to our dealings with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will only keep your information for as long as we are either
          required to by law or as is relevant for the purposes for which it was
          collected.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can visit the Site and browse without having to provide personal
          details. During your visit to the Site you remain anonymous and at no
          time can we identify you unless you have an account on the Site and
          log on with your username and password.
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold">Data that we collect</h4>
        <p>
          We may collect various pieces of information if you seek to place an
          order for a product with us on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect, store, and process your data for processing your purchase
          on the Site and any possible later claims, and to provide you with our
          services. We may collect personal information including, but not
          limited to, your title, name, gender, date of birth, email address,
          postal address, delivery address (if different), telephone number,
          mobile number, fax number, payment details, payment card details or
          bank account details.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use the information you provide to enable us to process your
          orders and to provide you with the services and information offered
          through our website which you request. Further, we will use the
          information you provide to administer your account with us; verify and
          carry out financial transactions in relation to payments you make;
          audit the downloading of data from our website; improve the layout
          and/or content of the pages of our website and customize them for
          users; identify visitors on our website; carry out research on our
          users' demographics; send you information we think you may find useful
          or which you have requested from us, including information about our
          products and services, provided you have indicated that you have not
          objected to being contacted for these purposes. Subject to obtaining
          your consent we may contact you by email with details of other
          products and services. If you prefer not to receive any marketing
          communications from us, you can opt-out at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may pass your name and address on to a third party to make delivery
          of the product to you (for example to our courier or supplier). You
          must only submit to us the Site information which is accurate and not
          misleading and you must keep it up to date and inform us of changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your actual order details may be stored with us but for security
          reasons cannot be retrieved directly by us. However, you may access
          this information by logging into your account on the Site. Here you
          can view the details of your orders that have been completed, those
          which are open, and those which are short to be dispatched and
          administer your address details, bank details (for refund purposes),
          and any newsletter to which you may have subscribed. You undertake to
          treat the personal access data confidentially and not make it
          available to unauthorized third parties. We cannot assume any
          liability for the misuse of passwords unless this misuse is our fault.
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold">Other uses of your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
          We may use your personal information for opinion and market research.
          Your details are anonymous and will only be used for statistical
          purposes. You can choose to opt out of this at any time. Any answers
          to surveys or opinion polls we may ask you to complete will not be
          forwarded on to third parties. Disclosing your email address is only
          necessary if you would like to take part in competitions. We save the
          answers to our surveys separately from your email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also send you other information about us, the Site, our other
          websites, our products, sales promotions, our newsletters, and
          anything relating to other companies in our group or our business
          partners. If you would prefer not to receive any of this additional
          information as detailed in this paragraph (or any part of it) please

          7 working days (days which are neither (i) a Friday, nor (ii) a public
          holiday anywhere in Bangladesh) of receipt of your instruction we will
          cease to send you information as requested. If your instruction is
          unclear we will contact you for clarification.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may further anonymize data about users of the Site generally and
          use it for various purposes, including ascertaining the general
          location of the users and usage of certain aspects of the Site or a
          link contained in an email to those registered to receive them and
          supplying that anonymized data to third parties such as publishers.
          However, that anonymized data will not be capable of identifying you
          personally.
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold">Competitions</h4>
        <p>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold">Third Parties and Links</h4>
        <p>
          We may pass your details to other companies in our group. We may also
          pass your details to our agents and subcontractors to help us with any
          of our uses of your data set out in our Privacy Policy. For example,
          we may use third parties to assist us with delivering products to you,
          to help us to collect payments from you, to analyze data, and to
          provide us with marketing or customer service assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may exchange information with third parties for fraud protection
          and credit risk reduction. We may transfer our databases containing
          your personal information if we sell our business or part of it. Other
          than as set out in this Privacy Policy, we shall NOT sell or disclose
          your personal data to third parties without obtaining your prior
          consent unless this is necessary for the purposes set out in this
          Privacy Policy or unless we are required to do so by law. The Site may
          contain advertising of third parties and links to other sites or
          frames of other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for
          the privacy practices or content of those third parties or other
          sites, nor for any third party to whom we transfer your data in
          accordance with our Privacy Policy.

                The acceptance of cookies is not a requirement for visiting the

                Internet browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be
                used to recognize your Internet Protocol address, saving you
                time while you are on, or want to enter the Site. We only use
                cookies for your convenience in using the Site (for example to
                remember who you are when you want to amend your shopping cart
                without having to re-enter your email address) and not for
                obtaining or using any other information about you (for example
                targeted advertising). Your browser can be set to not accept
                cookies, but this would restrict your use of the Site. Please
                accept our assurance that our use of cookies does not contain
                any personal or private details and is free from viruses.
